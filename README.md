# What the project is about

## This project is based on project organization and appropriate file naming methods that are essential for project work. Collaboration is very important in such project work, therefore, it would be best to organize project work in a way where all collaborators would have no problems navigating through it and identifying files that they want to access. This leads to less time spent actually finding the files. Overall, project work should follow a well-structured workflow that leads to more work being done and a reduction in important data being lost.
